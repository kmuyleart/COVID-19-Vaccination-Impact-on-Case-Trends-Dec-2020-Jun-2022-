# COVID-19 Vaccination Impact Analysis (Dec 2020 â€“ June 2022)

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project explores the **impact of COVID-19 vaccination rates on case trends** across U.S. states from **December 17, 2020 to June 16, 2022**. It combines **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Excel** to analyze how vaccination coverage influenced the spread of the virus.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Data Sources

- **Power BI**
  - Built interactive dashboards and visuals
  - Created **new tables** using **Power Query** and **DAX**
  - Performed **data modeling**, joins, and calculated measures
- **SQL (SQLite)**
  - Queried, filtered, and aggregated raw data
  - Used joins and subqueries to prepare data for visualization
- **Excel**
  - Used to **export SQL query results** and organize interim datasets
  - Performed light preprocessing before importing into Power BI
- **CDC Case Surveillance** â€“ COVID-19 case counts
- **CDC Vaccination GitHub** â€“ Vaccination and booster data
- **U.S. Census Bureau** â€“ State population estimates

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

To evaluate the **impact of COVID-19 vaccination** on case trends and determine whether higher vaccination rates correspond with **lower case growth** at the state level.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Vaccination Threshold

A **70% fully vaccinated** benchmark was used, in line with the **World Health Organization (WHO)** recommendation for community protection.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

- States with **higher vaccination rates** generally experienced **lower increases in COVID-19 cases**.
- The analysis highlights the **top 5 most populous states** â€” **California (CA), Texas (TX), Florida (FL), New York (NY), and Pennsylvania (PA)** â€” to examine how vaccination progress related to their respective case trends.
- While additional factors such as population density, public policy, and variant spread influenced case numbers, vaccination appeared to have a **notable impact in reducing transmission and case severity**.
